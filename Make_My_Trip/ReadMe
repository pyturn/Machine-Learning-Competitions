Dataset is provided with 17 columns labeled A-P, out of which A-O columns are the features and P is the label. Column Id are 
the unique number for every row.  
Your job is to build a machine learning model to predict column P using all or some of the feature columns.
The submission should be a csv file stating id along with the predicted label.

Files Provided in Dataset -

Following are the files that will be provided in the dataset -

  Train.csv  - This file contains all the above mentioned columns. You are expected to train your models on this file.
  Test.csv  - This file contains all the above mentioned columns except “P” column. You have to predict this column for each records given in this file.
  Sample_submission.csv  - This file consists of sample submissions. Your submission should be in exact same format.
  
  
 I compared different machine learning models and also done the model stacking. My Leaderboard Rank was 127. My overall score
 was 113.4058/130 and my machine learning problem score was 88.4050
