# Machine-Learning-Competitions

This repository contains the models of all the Machine Learning Competitions I participated. I believe in more and more participation in ongoing challenges. As with participation has lot iof advantages like -

1. Meritocracy - In Machine Learning Competitions ranks are completely based on merit. The system is also transparent, everyone has access to the same material and leaderboard. 

2. Results - Results of the competetion shows that it is not the academics that do well, but those with adaptive engineering mindset that use that work to get the result. 

3. Innovation - Competetion results is useful for technological innovation. The state of the art result are broken every time. This mostly occours because the problems are well specified.

**Finally work more and more to make this world a better place.**
